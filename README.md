### Authentication

The app uses **Client Credentials Flow** for server-to-server authentication:

- Tokens auto-refresh when expired (1-hour lifetime)
- No user login required

## Usage

3. Press Enter or click the search button
4. Click on an artist from the results

### Using the Anniversary Filter

2. Select a **Target Year** (e.g., 2026)
3. Choose an **Anniversary Increment**:
   - Every 5 years
   - Every 10 years
   - Every 15 years
   - Every 20 years
   - Every 25 years
4. The album grid automatically updates to show only anniversary albums

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite using Vitest and React Testing Library.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on file changes)
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```


## Current Limitations:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Spotify API has rate limits
   - Basic tier: ~180 requests per minute
   - App caches tokens to minimize requests
   
2. **Album Duplicates**: Some albums appear in multiple markets
   - App filters most duplicates automatically
   - Occasionally some variants may appear

3. **Missing Album Data**: 
   - Some older albums lack high-quality images
   - App displays vinyl icon placeholder when images unavailable
   - Label information may be missing for some releases

4. **Authentication Scope**:
   - Uses Client Credentials (no user login)
   - Cannot access user-specific data (playlists, saved albums)

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Tailwind Styles Not Loading

```bash
# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### Spotify API Errors

**"Failed to authenticate with Spotify":**
- Verify `.env` file exists in root directory
